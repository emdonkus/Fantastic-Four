1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the oat flour, garbanzo bean flour, all purpose flour, baking soda, sugar and salt. Mix well.
2. In another bowl, combine the milk and vinegar. Stir well.
3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, then mix well until a uniform dough forms. The dough will be slightly wet and tacky (that is okay!).
4. Fold the dried currants into the batter, if using.
5. Heat a cast iron skillet, griddle or nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Spray with oil or add just enough to coat.
6. Using wet hands or an ice cream scoop, take a tennis ball-sized dollop of batter and pat into a 4-inch round cake that is 1/4-inch-1/2-inch thick. 
7. Place into the greased skillet and cook for 3-4 minutes or until the edges are turning golden. Flip and cook 3-4 minutes longer until both sides have browned and the middle feels firm. Repeat with the remaining batter.
8. Serve warm and enjoy!
