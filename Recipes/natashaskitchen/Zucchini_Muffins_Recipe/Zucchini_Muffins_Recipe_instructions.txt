1. Preheat the oven to 350˚F. Grease a 12-count muffin pan or line with cupcake liners.
2. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon. 
3.  In a separate bowl, thoroughly whisk together eggs, oil, sugar, milk, and vanilla. 
4. Add flour mixture to the wet ingredients and whisk until well blended and smooth.
5. Grate zucchini on the large holes of a box grater and fold into the batter until well incorporated then fold in 1/3 cup of chocolate chips (if using).
6. Using a trigger-release ice cream scoop, divide the batter evenly into the 12-cup lined muffin pan. Sprinkle the tops of the muffins with the remaining chocolate chips. Bake at 350˚F for 22-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let muffins cool in the tins for 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool to room temperature.
