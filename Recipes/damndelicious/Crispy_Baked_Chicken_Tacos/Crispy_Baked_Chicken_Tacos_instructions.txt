1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Lightly oil a baking sheet or coat with nonstick spray.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon canola oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium high heat. Add ground chicken, onion and garlic, and cook until browned, about 3-5 minutes, making sure to crumble the chicken as it cooks; drain excess fat.
3. Stir in green chiles, chili powder, paprika, oregano and cumin until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes.
4. Remove from heat. Stir in cilantro and lime juice; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Stir in 1 cup cheese until well combined.
5. Working one at a time, spread chicken mixture on half of the tortilla; top with 1 tablespoon cheese, folding over to seal. Repeat with remaining tortillas to make 8 tacos.
6. Place tacos in a single layer onto the prepared baking sheet. Brush tops with remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons canola oil.
7. Place into oven and bake until toasted and crispy, about 12-15 minutes.
8. Serve immediately with desired toppings.
