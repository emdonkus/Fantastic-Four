1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. 
2. Season beef with 2 teaspoons salt and 3/4 teaspoon black pepper.
3. Heat canola oil in a Dutch oven over medium high heat. Add beef and cook until evenly browned, about 5-6 minutes per side; set aside.
4. Reduce heat to medium. Add onion, and cook, stirring frequently, until tender, about 5 minutes.
5. Stir in tomato paste and garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute.
6. Stir in wine and beef stock, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the Dutch oven.
7. Stir in carrots, mushrooms, thyme and rosemary; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer. Top with beef.
8. Place into oven, covered, and bake for 2 hours. Uncover and add potatoes; place into oven, covered, and bake until beef is fork-tender, about 1 hour to 1 hour and 30 minutes.
9. Let stand 15 minutes. Remove beef from the Dutch oven; shred, using two forks.
10. Serve beef, potatoes, carrots and mushrooms with juices immediately, garnished with parsley, if desired.
