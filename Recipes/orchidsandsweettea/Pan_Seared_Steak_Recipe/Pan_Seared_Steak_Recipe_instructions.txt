1. Start by patting dry the steaks on both sides with paper towels. Generously season the sides with salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and smoked paprika.
2. Heat a medium 10-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until hot and add the olive oil to coat the bottom. Once hot, add the steaks to the skillet and sear the steaks on the first side for 4-5 minutes or until a brown crust has formed and using tongs, turn them onto their opposite sides-------searing for another 4-5 minutes. 
3. Now, reduce the heat to medium and add the butter, garlic cloves, and thyme sprigs on the sides of the steaks in the pan. As the butter melts, spoon the butter sauce over the steak, slightly tilting the pan. 
4. Continue to spoon the butter sauce atop steaks for another 1-2 minutes. NOTE: Be sure to check the internal temperature of your steaks for desired doneness. 
5. Internal temperature notes: 
6. Medium Rare: 130°–135°; Medium: 140°–145°, Medium Well: 150°–155°; Well Done: 160°–165.
7. Once done, transfer the steaks onto a cutting board to "rest" for about 10 minutes before slicing and adding any garnish and/or sauce. 
8. Serve with your favorite side: mashed potatoes, baked potatoes, salad, basmati rice, brown rice, mac + cheese, etc. 
9. Bon Appetit!
