1. Gently pound the thicker end of the breast to 1/2-inch thickness so the chicken cooks evenly. Season chicken on both sides with 1 teaspoon salt, garlic powder and black pepper, to taste.
2. Dredge each chicken piece in flour, shaking off any excess.
3. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large deep skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken and cook for about 3 to 4 minutes per side or until the chicken is cooked through and has a golden-brown crust. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set it aside and wipe the skillet.
4. In the same skillet, reduce heat to medium-low and add the remaining 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil. Add the minced shallot and garlic and saut√© for about 2-3 minutes until they become fragrant and translucent.
5. Add the bell pepper and spinach, season with a pinch of salt and pepper and cover, cook until the spinach wilts down stirring 2 to 3 times, about 4 to 5 minutes.
6. Reduce the heat to low, and then add the cream cheese, chicken broth, half-and- half, 1/4 teaspoon salt and parmesan cheese and mix well until cream cheese is melted and the sauce is well combined.
7. Return the chicken and any of its juices to the skillet with the spinach and let it simmer in the sauce for a few minutes until heated through.
