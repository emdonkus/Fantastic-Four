1. If using wooden skewers, soak about 1 hour.
2. Cut small ends off corn and cut each into 6 pieces, to give you 12 total.
3. Arrange the skewers, alternating each veggie so you have 2 pieces of each vegetable on each skewer. Spritz all over with olive oil and season with salt.
4. Preheat the grill to medium-high heat.
5. Combine BBQ sauce and water in a small bowl.
6. Place kabobs on the grill and cook, turning often until the vegetables are slightly charred and tender, about 10 minutes.
7. Brush the bbq sauce on the veggies, the last minute of cooking, and turn once again.
