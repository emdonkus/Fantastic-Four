1. To make the sauce, whisk the water and cornstarch in a small bowl until smooth. Add the soy sauce, rice vinegar, brown sugar, ginger, and sriracha (if using). Set aside.
2. In a large deep skillet or wok, heat the oil over high heat until it shimmers and is nearly smoking. Add the shrimp, in a single layer if possible, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes, or until they’re mostly pink (they’ll finish cooking in the remaining steps).
3. Add the asparagus and red bell peppers and stir fry for 1 minute.
4. Pour in the sauce, stir to coat, and cook until the sauce is glossy and starting to thicken, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
5. Serve with cooked rice and sprinkle with sesame seeds just before serving.
