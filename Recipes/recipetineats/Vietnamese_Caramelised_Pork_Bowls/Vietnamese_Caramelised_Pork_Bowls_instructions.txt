1. Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat.
2. Add the onion, ginger, garlic and chili and cook for 2 minutes.
3. Add the sugar and fish sauce. Stir, then leave it to cook without touching until all the juices cook out and the pork starts caramelised - about 2 minutes. Then stir it and leave it again, without stirring, for around 30 seconds to get more caramelisation. Repeat twice more until caramelised to your taste.
