Presentaiton

    Project:
        Title of Project
        Team members' names
        Vision and Description of the Product

    All the tools your team used
        Name of the tool and purpose
        Your team's evaluation of the tool: Excellent? Useless?

    Challenges you encountered, how you overcame them, how your plans changed
        Evan - Coming from industry where coding standards are laid out and rigidily enforced, I think one fo the bigger challenges we would ahve faced sooner rather later was how our code was orginzed. Our codebase was organically made sicne everyone was doing their own thing. As we began to integrate parts (eg database to web, extraction to database), I was noticing that a lot of our issues were because the code was in different spots. Some of our scripts were developed in the notes area and some were in top level or a separate directory. IF we were to continue developing this, we would need to step back as osme point and make sure to setup better standards. 

    Demonstration of your project

Here are some of the possible tools that should be included in your presentation:

    project tracker = Trello, useless not great, it took a lot of upfront to set it up for tasking and lacked good features forrelating it to version controlling. I think this tool, as all task managmenet/project tracking tools, takes a concentrated effort from users to maintian and update. For our small project, tasking was sorted out effectively at our meetings and we were able to make sure everyone was involved. For larger projects I know that a tool like this is necessary but I think that more often than not large orgs also ahve dedicated people to managing tools and encouraging use. 
    version control = github, great, For a novice, Git is magical thing that poeple just say. Git to a seasoned programmer is a lifeline. The best way to learn it is to use it. I think to get the best use out of git, a remote area is absolutely essential. One of the things, I have noticed from professional world is that once an ecosystem of applications is chosen (ie Atlassion products), it often easier to go full bore into them than to back off. We are using github for remote version control. IF we had gone full integration with different management software, I think we would have setup better tasking system and more formal CM rules. 
    database
    testing =  pytest, great
    auto-documenter
    deployment environment
    programming languages and frameworks
        bash, simple easy to use for file manipulation
        python, great for lots of things
    code editors
        gvim/vim, great base tool with powerful features, vim is not as good in a web environemtn like jupyterhub
