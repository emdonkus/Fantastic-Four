Vision statement: what would you tell potential customers?
    Every felt like you have too many pdf recipes on your computer taking up space? Tired of scrolling through someone's entire origin story just to get to your pork shoulder recipe? It's time to CutNPasta that recipe into your own personal recipe database. Plan out your recipes ahead of time and turn it into a shopping list. View just the recieps and remove those annoying backstories when you just want to eat.

Motivation: why are you working on this project?
    Been busy and looking at online recipes and saving off all the pdfs to my local computer area. Annoying to search through all of the saved ones for things I want.
    
Risks to project completion, possibly including:
    1) new language or working environment
    2) no prior experience working with these team members
    3) different formats for different websites on where recipe is presented
    

Mitigation Strategy for above risks
    1) Learning language from class labs and exploration
    2) Work with team and figure out everyone's specialties, Have frequent meetings to share, learn, and discuss progress
    3) Generating templates scripts for specific websites, limit scope to a few websites and potentially expand later

Development method: scrum, kanban, waterfall: with specifics!
    Scrumban with frequent scrum meetings and using a kanban board to track issues.
